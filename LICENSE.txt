Err, Err, Err-Error Watch

Errors are everywhere
Causing you problems messing up your hair
They'll trip you up, give you a flat tire
Or make your socks go missing in the dryer
Errors make mischief anywhere
And you may not even believe they're there
But let me introduce you to my friend
He's found a way to connect with them
He's got a...

Error, ERROR Watch
He's going to build a supernatural entourage
He can talk to the spirits
He doesn't have to fear it
And they're always going to hear it
Cause you know he's got a Yo-Kai Watch

Yo-Kai, Yo-Kai Watch
Yo-Kai, Yo-Kai Watch
He can talk to the spirits
He doesn't have to fear it
And they're always going to hear it
Cause you know he's got a Yo-Kai Watch
